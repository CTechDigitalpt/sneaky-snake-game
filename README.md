# Free Sneaky Snake Game

Welcome to **Sneaky Snake**, a modern take on the classic Snake game! This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and includes exciting features to enhance your gaming experience.

The game is called "Sneaky Snake" because of the snake's ability to slip through walls and appear on the opposite side – a sneaky maneuver that adds a strategic element to the classic gameplay. Unlike traditional snake games where walls mean instant death, our sneaky serpent can navigate the playing field with cunning movements that reward tactical thinking.

## Features

- **Classic Gameplay**: Navigate the snake to eat food and grow longer while avoiding collisions.
- **Customizable Colors**: Change the snake and food colors with a simple button click.
- **Level Progression**: Advance through levels automatically as your score increases (every 100 points).
- **High Score Tracking**: Your top 10 scores are saved locally and displayed on screen.
- **Demo Mode**: Watch an automated snake demo with adjustable speed.
- **Wall Wrapping**: Snake can move through walls and appear on the opposite side.
- **Pause Functionality**: Pause and resume gameplay anytime.
- **Dark Mode**: Toggle between light and dark themes for a personalized experience.
- **Responsive Design**: Play the game on various devices with a responsive layout.

## How to Play

1. Use the arrow keys to control the snake's direction.
2. Eat the food (small squares) to grow longer and increase your score by 10 points.
3. Avoid colliding with the snake's own body.
4. Pass through walls to appear on the opposite side of the screen.
5. Every 100 points, you'll advance to the next level.
6. Game ends when the snake collides with itself.

## Controls

- **Arrow Keys**: Move the snake (up, down, left, right).

## High Scores

The game automatically saves your top 10 highest scores locally in your browser. These scores are displayed in the high scores panel, allowing you to track your progress and challenge yourself to beat your personal best.

** Scores are saved in your web browser's cache. This eliminates the need for server-side storage, allowing the game to function completely offline and without requiring any backend infrastructure. If you wish to start fresh and reset all high scores, simply clear your browser cache for this site. **
